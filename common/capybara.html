            <h2>About Capybaras</h2>
            <p>Capybaras are the largest rodents in the world, weighing up to 66 kilograms (145 pounds) and measuring up to 1.3 meters (4.3 feet) in length. They are native to South America, where they live in groups near bodies of water such as rivers, lakes, and swamps.</p>
            <p>Capybaras have webbed feet and can swim well, and they can also hold their breath underwater for up to five minutes. They have a lifespan of around eight to ten years in the wild, and up to 12 years in captivity.</p>
            <p>These herbivorous animals feed mainly on grasses, aquatic plants, and fruits. They have a unique digestive system that allows them to digest cellulose, a tough fiber found in plant cell walls, with the help of microorganisms in their stomachs.</p>
            <p>Capybaras are social animals and often live in groups of up to 20 individuals. They communicate with each other through a variety of vocalizations, such as barks, whistles, and grunts, and also through scent marking.</p>
            <p>Due to their friendly and docile nature, capybaras have become popular as pets in some parts of the world, although they require a lot of space and care to thrive.</p>
            <p><strong>Weight:</strong> Capybaras weigh up to 66 kilograms (145 pounds).</p>
            <p><strong>Length:</strong> Capybaras measure up to 1.3 meters (4.3 feet) in length.</p>
            <p><em>Note: 1 foot = 0.3048 meters, 1 pound = 0.4536 kilograms</em></p>
            <p><strong>Random Fact:</strong> Did you know that capybaras are semi-aquatic animals that spend a lot of their time in the water? They have specialized hairs on their skin that help to trap air, which allows them to stay submerged for longer periods of time. In fact, they are so well adapted to aquatic life that they can even sleep underwater while keeping their noses above the surface to breathe!</p>
